Code for the development of a personal website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This project is the build up of a website to display more information about myself as a person, as a professional, and a bit into my hobbies.

Initially, as all websites must, this will be a very basic website with HTML and CSS files comprising the bulk of the website.

As I continue however, I will be adding more complex functions, such as the 'Photos' page which has the first JavaScript function on the website.

This will be a work in progress, so this will be changing and improving over time, hope you can enjoy!
