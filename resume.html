    <h2>Skills</h2>
          <h3 class="attributes">
          Communication</h3>
          <p class="main-text"> Ability to communicate clearly and concisely with internal and external stakeholders. An example of this is with Vocus Communication, where I was the project  lead I would be tasked with organising resources for delivery whilst managing client communication with milestones and issues, to ensure delivery on schedule.</p>
          <h3 class="attributes">Analytical</h3>
          <p class="main-text"> Ability to critically review a task and work towards the best solution for all parties. For example, with Vocus, we had a client who could not connect to the internet on delivery of the service. After reviewing the potential issues of the service, I determined that the problem was with the fibre optic on the modem and was able to have this swapped, which resulted in the service then working and the client satisfied.</p>
          <h3 class="attributes">Interpersonal</h3>  
          <p class="main-text"> Ability to develop and maintain relationships both internal and external. For example, with Vocus I was delivering an internet service for a broadcaster at the Australian Open tennis tournament. There had been delays on the physical work and this was in danger of being delivered late, however using my relationship with our software team, I was able to escalate and prioritise the service to ensure that the work was completed on time and the event could be broadcast.</p>
          <h3 class="attributes">Organisational</h3> 
          <p class="main-text"> Ability to track and manage several complex tasks. With Vocus communications, I was responsible for the management and delivery of on average 60 individual services for clients. My ability to prioritise, organise and communicate with all relevant parties ensured that delivery of the service was executed seamlessly within project deadlines.</p>
